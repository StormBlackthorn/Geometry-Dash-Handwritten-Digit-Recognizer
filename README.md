# Geometry-Dash-Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer
Using [G.js](https://github.com/g-js-api/G.js/), I was able to make a semi-working neuro network that allows you to draw on a canvas in a Geometry Dash level and guess the number that you've drawn.
It only works for 7 and 1, and even then it only works half the times. I have no idea why :(
